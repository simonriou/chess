- Reweight the loss:
    - use weighted MSE giving higher weight to extreme values
    - use Hubber loss to balance MSE & MAE
- Stratified sampling:
    - ensure each batch has a good ditribution of values
- Rescale the target:
    - transform output to amplify distinctions (e.g. sigmoid mapping [-1, 1] and train to predict sigmoid-transformed)
- Regular eval:
    - log predictions on a fixed val set after every epoch to detect regressions
- Output layer:
    - ensure last layer is linear!!
